# C-Quiz
A short quiz about C++ language
The program displays a questionnaire with 10 questions, each with 4 alternatives that allows the user to choose one of 4 alternatives by typing one of the numbers 1,2,3 or 4. If the user gives the wrong alternative a message displayed is: “Error! You have ____ points ”and then move on to the next question.

If the user gives the correct alternative, the message displayed is: “Correct! You have _____ points ”and then move on to the next question.

If the user enters a number other than 1,2,3 or 4, the message displayed is: “Wrong number! Please provide the correct alternative ”and the program must read a new value until it is from 1 to 4.

At the end of the questionnaire the program should display the result of the points at the end of the test and the corresponding grade.

If the number of points is 1- 4, the grade is set to 4. For 5-10 the grade is set as the number.
